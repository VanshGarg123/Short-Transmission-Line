# Transmission Line Short Model Simulation

This project simulates a **three-phase short transmission line model** in Simulink and analyzes the sending and receiving end parameters of the system.

## 📌 Objective

To compare and visualize the **line-to-neutral voltages**, **line currents**, and **apparent power** at both sending and receiving ends of a short transmission line using:

- RMS voltage and current
- Apparent Power (VA)

## 🧰 Requirements

- MATLAB & Simulink (R2020 or newer recommended)
- Simscape Electrical toolbox
